kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.11.1/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml

| This nginx controller for ingress is a community driven project and is quite popular ingress to use.



# Install Nginx Ingress Controller on AWS
Deploy the below manifest in aws eks as it is, from the terminal you are operating on:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.11.1/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml

| A new namespace called 'ingress-nginx' will be created in which all the ingress resources will be created.
| Do a kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx

| A new load balancer will be created on AWS EKS when this is applied. Take the address url of that load balancer
| and map with the host name you gave in ingress manifest file:

```
  rules:
  - host: {{.Values.ingress.host}} # map this one with ingress load balancer ip address using nslookup
```

| How to map this nginx aws load balancer ip-adress with our ingress host name locally?

0. Make sure the project helm chart is already deployed with the ingress.
1. Apply this: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.11.1/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
2. Then do a kubectl get ing
3. Copy the load balancer address (which will not be in ipadress right now but a long string)
4. Run nslookup <paste in the copied ingress load balancer address from step 3>
   You will get many numerical ip-addresses. Choose the last one or any if you like.
5.On linux go the path below:
  Go to this path -> /etc/hosts and map them like:
  aws loadbalancer ip address : ingress host name

6. Here is a more concrete example:
```
root@Acer:~# kubectl get ing
NAME                CLASS   HOSTS             ADDRESS                                                                          PORTS   AGE

root@Acer:~# nslookup afd1e224cce414033908cdb1188a213e-8b76cb7ce7835aef.elb.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

root@Acer:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       Acer.   Acer
3.6.17.137 videotube.local # Here like this

```

7. Now go to your linux system browser and open 'videotube.local' and you app must be seen there.
