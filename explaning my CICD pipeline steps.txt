My laptop
  - I will do changes in my project code and push to main branch of my github repo
  - The github-actions will see the changes and run/trigger the CI workflows i created.

CI
  - Step 1 is to build the project code
  - Step 2 is to do static code analysis
  - Step 3 is to build a new docker image and push it to docker hub
  - Step 4 is to update our existing helm chart's 'values.yaml' file
    where the container image's tag will be updated as new image is created

# So now after CI: 
  # A new docker image is created+pushed, 
  # which contains my recent code changes i pushed to main branch.
  # Also my project (videotube) helm chart's 'values.yaml' file is updated by CI to refer to this new docker image on docker hub.

CD
  - ArgoCD will look for changes in the values.yaml of the helm chart
  - ArgoCD will now pull the helm chart with the updated values.yaml
  - ArgoCD will deploy this helm chart on EKS.
  - Done

Monitoring and Logging:
  - These will be added manually and separately from this pipeline.
